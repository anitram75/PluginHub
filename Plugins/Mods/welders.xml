  <Description>Tweaks large grid welders to increase their welding radius from the default 2.26m to 2.65m. This makes them easier to use in printers, which have trouble with blocks like lights, LCD panels, and gatling turrets. These blocks require the welder to be outside the block's voxels to place the block, but then within the model's bounding box to finish the weld. The default radius makes it difficult for an automatic printer to position the welder to both place and weld these blocks. Increasing the weld radius just slightly makes positioning less critical while not making welders too overpowered.</Description>
